# Learn to Code Lesson Repo
Welcome to the LTC lesson repository! Here's where we store and you can contribute to lessons that appear on our project, [LearntoCode](https://aghastmuffin.github.io/learntocode). Please note that currently in order to contribute, you must either be a moderator, a trusted user, or have your code reviewed before being merged. There are many ways to help out! You could proofread code, fixing bugs, or develop more engaging lessons, or build extra lessons, or just learn!
# A little about ourselves
LTC is a free-to-use free-to-maintain open source software designed to promote STEM learning in underprevileged or struggling communities- however anyone can use it! It is hosted graciously by github through github pages, and all code is provided free of charge to anyone that wishes to create using us or build their own. The one stipulation being that you may face legal action by using our code in a **paid** software. As outlined [here](), please note that for now, this only applies to our renderer and implementation of the free software [pyodide](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide). Have fun, and thank you for contributing to our little corner of the internet.
# How do I start?
This is the place for lesson creators to begin. If you want to learn, please click [here](https://aghastmuffin.github.io/learntocode). To start off, please create a .toml file, to build your lesson in. This is the recommended flow, however if you believe you are proficcient in .ltclesson, then feel free to start with that.
**Step 1**
Create Toml
**Step 2**
Decide what topic the lesson focuses on. Gather required modules to code a working example.
**Step 3**
Write text, and include examples of code, following this more in depth example.
**Step 4**
Open a pull request! Our mods will look into it. Currently our .ltclessson converter is not open source, as it is primarily done by hand. However, you can also fork a Toml file. 
**Thank you!**
